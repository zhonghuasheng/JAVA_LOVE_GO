*//**
 * An iterator over a collection.  {@code Iterator} takes the place of
 * {@link Enumeration} in the Java Collections Framework.  Iterators
 * differ from enumerations in two ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *      <li> Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the
 *           underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined
 *           semantics.
 *      <li> Method names have been improved.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements returned by this iterator

     * return an element rather than throwing an exception.)

    *//**
     * Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
     * by this iterator (optional operation).  This method can be called
     * only once per call to {@link #next}.  The behavior of an iterator
     * is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified while the
     * iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this
     * method.

     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the {@code remove}
     *         operation is not supported by this iterator
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the {@code next} method has not
     *         yet been called, or the {@code remove} method has already
     *         been called after the last call to the {@code next}
     *         method
