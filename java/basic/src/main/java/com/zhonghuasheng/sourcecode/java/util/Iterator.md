### Summary

#### JDK1.7 methods
* boolean hasNext();
* E next();
* void remove();

#### JDK1.8 methods
* boolean hasNext();
* E next();
* default void remove() `JDK1.8新增加的方法，default是JDK1.8的新技术Virtual extension method`
* default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action) 

### Source Code

#### JDK1.8

/**
 * An iterator over a collection.  {@code Iterator} takes the place of
 * {@link Enumeration} in the Java Collections Framework.  Iterators
 * differ from enumerations in two ways:
 *`Iterator在collection之上，在JAVA集合框架中取代了Enumeration的功能，与Enumerations区别有以下两点
 * <ul>
 *      <li> Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the
 *           underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined
 *           semantics.
 * Iterator允许调用者删除element，Enumeration没有删除element的方法
 *      <li> Method names have been improved.
 * 性能上优于Enumeration
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements returned by this iterator

 * @since 1.2 JDK1.2开始支持，Enumeration是从1.0就开始了
