     * Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the

     * specified amount of time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor.
     * <p>
     * This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
     * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
     * any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
     * becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
     * until one of four things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
     * object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as

     * object.
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
     * thread <var>T</var>.
     * <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
     * {@code timeout} is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
     * consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
     * </ul>
     * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
     * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
     * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
     * object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
     * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
     * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
     * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
     * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
     * was invoked.
     * <p>
     * A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
     * timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
     * occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
     * the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
     * continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
     * waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
     * <pre>
     *     synchronized (obj) {
     *         while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
